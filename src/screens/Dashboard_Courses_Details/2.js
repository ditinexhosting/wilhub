                            <p>This course is based on the premise
that the first teacher is our 'Mom.'
The programme is designed to
help parents involve their children
in Islamic learning and nurture their
family upon Islamic ethics.</p>
<p>Receive, Register, and Recall are the three phases of a child's
learning.<br><br>
Receive - This is the stage in which the child acquires intelligence for
the first time. The majority of this takes place in the classroom.<br><br>
Register - The point at which a child comprehends the information
that he or she has gained. This is most common at home. The child
begins to have doubts at this stage. The child will only be able to
comprehend it properly until these questions are cleared. When this
is not possible, it is either misunderstood or left unanswered.<br><br>
Recall - The stage in which what has been understood is put into
action.</p>
<p>The second step is crucial due to the
fact that if the child does not receive
the assistance he or she requires at
this stage, he/she will either not learn
or will learn incorrectly. As a
consequence, it will be useless when
the need arises later.</p>

<p>This is extremely important in Islamic
Studies. After all, the main goal of
Islamic teachings is to live by it.</p>
<p>A student, for example, who learns a
new section of the Qur'an in class, he
or she should be able to read the
part very well with Tajweed.
However, when they return home
and attempt to recite it, they begin
to develop doubts. There is,
however, no one at home who can
puzzle out these doubts. Naturally,
they either learn it wrong or ignore it.</p>
<p>This is particularly important when it
comes to Islamic Studies, including
the Holy Qur'an, Hadith, and Fiqh.</p>
                                                        </div>
                                                        <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top:40px;">
<p>This is why the 'Diploma in
Parenting and Home Management'
is so crucial which teach and train
parents to engage in their children's
school and Islamic studies and
overcome their doubts.</p>
<p>When parents engage and support
their children’s Islamic studies in this
way, they also will be able to learn
Islam better.</p>
<h3>Who is qualified to join?</h3>
<p>Admission is open to parents of all
ages. An individual who is planning
to become a parent after marriage
or a parent of a 15-year-old child
shall both benefit from this course.
It makes no difference how old or
educated the applicant is.</p>
