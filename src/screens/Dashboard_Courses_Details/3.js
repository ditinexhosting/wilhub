<p>Marriage is the sweetest core of life. Every marriage is a tie capable of
transforming the bitterness of life into sweetness. It's a lovely sensation when
two people become one. Marriage is also a binding agreement between
two people. It will continue until the Last Day, and then on to eternity, by
God's favour. Love, mutual cooperation, and compassion heighten the
sweetness of marriage. However, we can see around us individuals who
nurture it and also those who destroy it. The approach we must have
towards our marital life is wonderfully described in the Holy Qur'an and the
Prophetic Sunnah. Our responsibilities, like love, are also a crucial part of
those relationships. The beauty of marriage is enhanced by the fulfilment of
social, moral, and family responsibilities. Certain principles must be followed
and performed in order to complete such obligations and maintain the
warmth of our relationships. Mawadha provides you with an opportunity to
comprehend these beautiful lessons.</p>

<h3>The concept of Mawadha</h3>
<p>Mawadha is a Qur'anic term that encompasses a spouse's and partner's
mutual love and affection. Recognizing and accepting each other's
flaws, as well as being sympathetic and supportive in times of crisis, are all
important aspects of marital life.</p>
<p>Marriage and the concept of marriage is something that individuals take
care of. Marriage is a union of two individuals and it also brings together
two families in the community.</p>
<p>Marriage, like all other virtues, is a culture and, beyond that, the basis of
an established family structure. So it is better to make our marriage and
our life after marriage according to the ideals we uphold.</p>
